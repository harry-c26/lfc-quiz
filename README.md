## Testing

*  The website has been tested on chrome, edge and firefox and has the same appearance on all browsers.
*  The links all work and take you to the relevant page.
*  The website is responsive to different screen sizes and keeps a common layout on them.
*  The booking form works and will only submit when all of the fields are filled out with the correct information. 

## Validator testing

*  It has been tested on the HTML validator and has passed with 1 note regarding language when the website is set to English. As this is for menu items for an Italian restaurant I ignored this warning.
*  It has been tested on the CSS validator and has passed as well.
*  I have checked the website is responsive and functions on a variety of screen sizes using AmIResponsive as well as the inspection devtools.
*  I have also checked the site with Lighthouse which gave an overall score of 97 for accessibility.

### Others to mention

* A special thank you to support team for helping when I needed to take a break having had a number of personal distractions during the modules and completion of this project. 
* The [README guide](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples#credits) that Kera Cudmore put together was a great help as well. I've used my previous READme but I based on that on Kera's guide so it's only fair to give credit again.

## Further development plans

* Add further questions so there is a greater question pool to select from.
* Potential to add images, sound or videos throughout the quiz or at the end with tiers depending on the score the user achieves. 

## Things I've learned from my project

* Plan ahead with more thought into how I want me project to go and what the end result should look like. 
* Definitely start writing the README file at the start as part of my planning and use it as a working document. 
* Committing in smaller chunks and more often. 
* Remember less is more. My early ideas were a lot more complicated which would have been too time consuming to create.
